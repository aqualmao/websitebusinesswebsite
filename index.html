        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>I'm Aidyn, a current high school/dual enrollment student planning on majoring in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I have my CompTIA Tech+ Certification, and currently work as a Network Technician Intern. I plan to work for the Department of Defense after obtaining my Bachelors.</p>
        <h2>Why'd I start this business?</h2>
        <p>Mainly to help people! I often find myself seeing a small business without a website, and wondering what exactly that business does.</p>
        <p>Websites are an excellent way to show what you do to your potential customers/clients, and I have the skills to build people them.</p>
        <p>This is also in effort to fund my college education. In the case I do not recieve enough scholarships to afford my first year, I'll have to pay for it out of pocket.</p>
        <p>And as I already work two jobs, this would be the perfect thing to start in order to bring in just enough (along with giving me experience).</p>
        <!--<h2>Why this specifically though?</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was young I've been interested in computers and how they come together.</p>
        <p>Through this initial interest I discovered the various career choices that are available to me, and I really enjoy the idea of being a Network/Sys Admin.</p>
        <p>Ever since, I've been working as hard as I can to make myself the best candidate for that role.</p>!-->
